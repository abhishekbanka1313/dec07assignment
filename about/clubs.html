                        <p>The club has won 5 European Cups, more than any other English club, 3 UEFA Cups, 3 UEFA Super Cups, 18 League titles, 7 FA Cups, 8 League Cups, and 15 FA Community Shields.</p>
                        <p>Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played at Anfield since its formation.</p>
                        <p>Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and 1980s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to 11 League titles and seven European trophies.</p> 
                        <p>Under the management of Rafael Benítez and captained by Steven Gerrard, Liverpool became European champions for the fifth time in 2005.</p>
                        <p>Liverpool was the ninth highest-earning football club in the world in 2016–17, with an annual revenue of €424.2 million,[3] and the world's eighth most valuable football club in 2018, valued at $1.944 billion.[4] The club is one of the best supported teams in the world.</p>

                        <p>The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies: the Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, with 39 people – mostly Italians and Juventus fans – dying, after which English clubs were given a five-year ban from European competition, and the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 96 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing.</p>
                        <p>The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964 which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is "You'll Never Walk Alone".</p>
